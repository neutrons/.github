# Neutron Scattering Software

- We are a group of research software engineers and scientists developing and maintaining software for neutron scattering instruments at the [SNS](https://neutrons.ornl.gov/sns) and [HFIR](https://neutrons.ornl.gov/hfir) facilities at [ORNL](https://www.ornl.gov/).
- This organization is mainly for hosting research software related to **scattering** techniques, but we also have a few other projects that are not directly related to scattering.
- For software related to imaging, please go to the [Neutron Imaging](https://github.com/ornlneutronimaging) for more information.
